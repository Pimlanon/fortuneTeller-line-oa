# Tarot LINE OA Assistant (ChatGPT Integration)

This project was developed for a company contest with the goal of creating a LINE Official Account (LINE OA) integrated with ChatGPT, acting as an admin assistant to handle user interactions and coordinate with internal staff.

The system automates user communication, service management, and staff notifications while providing an interactive tarot reading service through chat.

## Project Overview

The LINE OA acts as a smart assistant that:

- Uses ChatGPT to interpret messages and respond intelligently

- Connects the user side with the staff side

- Automatically notifies staff groups when human support is required
